With an interactive map throughout the campus to help incoming and current students to not only find their lectures as well instruct them about approximate duration time it takes between buildings, facilities, open spaces, local shops and infrastructure. The application will further notify the students when they need to start walking to their next class and best routes to take between classes. With the premium version, the application will unlock more features for the users. They will have access to transit route tips from alumni from the university and a system to keep track of their schedule and time between classes. It will also come with an ad free feature for the premium users.
