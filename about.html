            With many students being late for campus and in extreme
            circumstances being late for exams costing them their education, six
            university students came together to form the number one web-mapping
            platform for university students all across Canada. With
            partnerships from the breathtaking sceneries found at campuses in
            British Columbia from the bustling metropolitan area found on the
            campuses of University of Toronto, we introduce Destination U.

            DestinationU is a new application designed and geared to help
            navigate university students at all universities across Canada. With
            an interactive map throughout the campus to help incoming and
            current students to not only find their lectures as well instruct
            them about approximate duration time it takes between buildings,
            facilities, open spaces, local shops and infrastructure. The
            application will further notify the students when they need to start
            walking to their next class and best routes to take between classes.
            With the premium version, the application will unlock more features
            for the users. They will have access to transit route tips from
            alumni from the university and a system to keep track of their
            schedule and time between classes. It will also come with an ad free
            feature for the premium users.

            We are a group of 6 univeristy who sturggled to make it to our
            classes on time. We decided to do something about it. This is why we
            created DestinationU. We wanted all university students accross
            Canada to have an easy access to a virtual campus map of their
            choosing.
